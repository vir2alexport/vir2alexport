# Hi, I am @vir2alexport

I create prototypes of web applications mainly, but not only. Sometimes I write software with python, go, c, c# or java. I have the most experience working with php, mysql, javascript, html, svg, css, json. I launched my first website in 2008 and since then my websites have never been hacked. I have always paid sufficient attention to security. I have worked with a lot of different APIs and created bots for Twitter, Telegram, Nostr etc. I had to deal with cryptography, mainly secp256k1 for cryptocurrency, but not only. You can find some of my projects on [my website](https://xport.top). I have never published most of my works because I don’t like to rush. In my entire life I have never gotten a regular 9 то 5 job because it was more important to me to implement my own ideas and help others implement theirs. I've built projects for others, consulted startups, helped them optimize and improve their products. When there are three options, I'm more likely to choose the fourth. When people tell me that I jump from idea to idea and that it’s bad, I don’t worry. They just don’t have that many ideas and they’ve never done anything like that. My professor said that jumping from one idea to another is good as long as you go back to previous ideas and finish them. That's what I do. I'm looking for easy ways, but I can't resist the temptation to try the hardest one to gain additional experience. I'm in no hurry to make decisions, but I quickly implement when I make a decision.
