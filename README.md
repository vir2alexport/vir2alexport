# Hi, I'm @vir2alexport.

I'm a full-stack developer specializing in web applications, with a strong focus on security and robust architecture. I build prototypes and software across a variety of languages, including Python, Go, C, C#, Java, and have deep expertise in PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and JSON.

## Highlights:
- Over 15 years of experience in web development, launching my first unhacked website in 2008.
- Experienced with a wide range of APIs, building bots for Twitter, Telegram, and Nostr.
- Expertise in cryptography, particularly with secp256k1 for cryptocurrency applications.
- Proven track record of building projects for startups, providing consulting, and optimizing products.
- My projects are a testament to a philosophy of thoughtful, high-quality implementation. While I'm in no rush to release, I am quick to execute once a decision is made.
